### Source 
	
	* The source code can be found in the `src` directory with name sobel.m
	* Run this source code in MATLAB R2014b and you will get a screen with a prompt to input an image.
	* Select the image from any directory
	* Move the slider to change the threshold of the sobel filter.
	* As you move the slide the threshold value will change and so will the gradient and edge images.
	* Real time interactive threshold changing is implemented using sliders.

### Input Images and Results: 
	
	The input and output images  can be found in the `inputs` and `outputs` directory resp. 
	All images have been generated using same threshold of 127.


### Running the Binary 
	
	Run the `./run_sobel.sh /usr/local/MATLAB/R2014b/` in the `binary` directory to get run the compiled binary.
	Please note to run the compiled binary you need a Unix system with a  MRC compiler installed.

### Reports
	It contains the presentation of the project. 
	Theory and computation
